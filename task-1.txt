NodeJS and Dependency Management

I put here all commands, which used for solving NodeJS practical tasks:

npm init (initialize package.json)
npm install -g fs-extra (install fs-extra package globally)
npm install -g fs-extra --save-dev (install fs-extra package globally with --save-dev)
npm -g list (to view the npm global packages list and their dependencies)
